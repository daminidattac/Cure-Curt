        question: 'What happens during a blood donation?',
        ans:'When you arrive at a blood donation center, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your health and medical history.

        question: 'Can I donate blood if I recently traveled to another country?',
        ans:'Recent travel to certain countries or regions may lead to temporary deferral from blood donation due to concerns about potential exposure to infectious diseases. The specific deferral period can vary depending on the country visited and the presence of specific diseases or outbreaks in that region. For example, if you have visited an area with a high risk of malaria, you may need to wait for a specified period before being eligible to donate. It is important to inform the blood donation center about your recent travel history, and they will provide guidance based on their policies and guidelines.',
